# Development Workflow Specification
Version: v1.0  
Language: English  
Audience: Developer + GPT

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **development workflow** for the scanner project.  
It ensures:

- consistent development across GPT sessions
- clean versioning
- reproducible migrations
- controlled spec→code evolution
- minimized context loss
- traceability between spec/config/snapshots

The workflow is designed to support a **GPT-assisted development style** with incremental refactoring.

---

## 2. Core Principles

The workflow follows these principles:

1. **Spec → Code → Snapshot → Backtest**
2. **Version everything**
3. **Track structural changes explicitly**
4. **Never overwrite context**
5. **Prefer additive iteration over rewrite**
6. **Preserve determinism**

---

## 3. Components Managed by Workflow

The workflow coordinates:

- `spec.md` (master technical spec)
- `/docs/*.md` (modular specs)
- `config.yml` (runtime parameters)
- `code_map.md` (structural overview of codebase)
- `README.md` (user/system guide)
- `gpt_snapshot.md` (context handoff between GPT sessions)
- snapshots (runtime data)
- backtest results (evaluation outputs)

---

## 4. Workflow Cycle (Core Loop)

Development cycle:

```
(1) Update Spec (if needed)
(2) Update Config (if needed)
(3) Implement Code
(4) Update Code-Map
(5) Update README
(6) Run Scanner
(7) Produce Snapshot(s)
(8) Optional Backtest
(9) Review / Adjust / Iterate
```

This loop is future-proof and compatible with research workflows.

---

## 5. Code-Map Integration

Whenever code changes structurally, developer/GPT must:

- update `code_map.md`
- reflect modules, functions, ownership, naming, interfaces

Code-map becomes the single source of truth for **repository structure**.

---

## 6. README Integration

README must explain:

- what the scanner does
- how to run it
- how to install dependencies
- how to schedule
- how to update config
- how to interpret outputs

README must not contain low-level architecture (that belongs to docs).

---

## 7. GPT-Snapshot Integration

GPT-Snapshot captures:

- recent changes
- context diffs
- open questions
- unresolved tasks
- constraints
- warnings/notes
- migration hints

Snapshot is fed into next GPT session to continue without context loss.

---

## 8. Version Control

Version control requirements:

- spec version
- config version
- code version
- snapshot version

Version increments on:

- scoring logic changes
- feature schema changes
- mapping rules changes
- pipeline changes
- config parameter changes

---

## 9. Development Modes

Workflow supports:

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| research | tune scoring + features |
| implementation | coding work |
| refactor | structural changes |
| debug | fix issues |
| backtest | evaluate setups |
| freeze | prepare release |

Modes allow GPT to adjust reasoning style.

---

## 10. Snapshot Discipline

Snapshots must be:

- immutable
- timestamped
- version-stamped
- backtest-compatible

No retroactive mutation.

---

## 11. Backtest Discipline

Backtest outputs must not overwrite:

- config
- spec
- code-map

Backtest informs, but does not mutate.

---

## 12. Migration Discipline

When spec changes materially:

1. increment spec version
2. adjust config if required
3. migrate code if required
4. regenerate snapshots if relevant
5. evaluate via backtest

This prevents “silent drift”.

---

## 13. GPT Collaboration Rules

GPT must:

- read spec before implementing
- read code_map before refactoring
- use snapshot for context recovery
- ask before structural rewriting
- never mutate spec without prompt
- never delete context

These rules prevent runaway architectural mutations.

---

## 14. Deliverables & Outputs

Workflow produces:

- code
- docs
- snapshots
- reports
- backtests

Artifacts must be consumable by human and machine.

---

## 15. Anti-Goals

The workflow must not:

- embed speculation into code
- optimize prematurely
- discard context
- silently refactor
- collapse setup types into one
- make hidden model changes

---

## 16. Extensible Workflow

Future modules may include:

- CLI tools
- execution modules
- dashboard
- metrics
- alerts
- parameter search

Workflow supports extension without rewrite.
